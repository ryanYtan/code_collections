The primary mission of the Registrar's Office (RO) is to facilitate the academic experience of students enrolled in the University, from the time of registration to graduation. The RO is responsible for keeping all student records (past and present) and ensuring the accuracy and integrity of such records; and for providing the secretariat to the University's Senate, which is the academic body that sets and controls the general direction of instruction, research, and examination leading to the award of degrees. In relation to this latter responsibility, the RO helps to enforce and implement academic and administrative policies; as well as provides assistance in the development of, and modifications to, such policies and procedures that will best serve the University community. The RO also supports the following activities: maintenance and publication of curricula; class and examination timetabling; new student registration; module enrolment; examination administration; and issue of official academic transcripts and degree scrolls.
